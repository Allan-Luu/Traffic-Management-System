# Traffic Management System
Hello, thank you for your interest in this traffic management system.
The goal of this project was to look into the concept of looking into a method of efficiently finding the shortest path given a set number of vertices or edges.

## Methods
In this project, I've tested out a few methods. 

1) Breadth First Search - using a graph to manage the edges/vertices and implementing the BFS algorithm to find shortest path
2) CNF-SAT Problem - framing the problem as a satisfiability problem where the boolean formulas are specified in conjuctive normal form
3) Approximation Algorithm 1 - an algorithm that takes the highest incident vertex, and removes all edges attached to this vertex, from the graph until empty
4) Approximation Algorithm 2 - an algorithm that randomly selects a vertex and removes all edges attached to this vertex, from the graph until empty

## Report

The [report.PDF](https://github.com/Allan-Luu/Traffic-Management-System/blob/master/report.pdf) contains the formal documentation of the final product, along with details surroudning the performance of the different algorithms.
